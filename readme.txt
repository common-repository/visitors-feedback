Capture valuable feedback from your website visitors before they leave.

== Description ==

Introducing "Exit Intent Visitor Feedback," a powerful WordPress plugin designed to help site owners understand why visitors are leaving their website. This plugin adds a unique feature that will trigger a pop-up form when a user intends to exit the site, allowing site owners to collect valuable feedback from their visitors.

With the Exit Intent Visitor Feedback plugin, site owners can gain insight into why visitors are leaving their site. Perhaps the website is difficult to navigate, or maybe the content isn't meeting visitors' expectations. Whatever the reason, this plugin provides a way to collect feedback from visitors in a non-intrusive way that doesn't disrupt their browsing experience.

The pop-up form is fully customizable, allowing site owners to tailor the questions to their specific needs. Whether they want to ask about the website's design, content, or services, the form can be configured to ask the right questions. Site owners can also customize the appearance of the pop-up form to match their website's branding.

The Exit Intent Visitor Feedback plugin is incredibly easy to install and use. Once installed, site owners can configure the plugin's settings from the WordPress dashboard. They can choose which pages the pop-up form will appear on, how often it will appear, and what questions will be asked.
